% Texture information is mostly contained within the image intensity 
% channel, so we apply Lawsâ€™ masks [15, 4] to this channel to compute the 
% texture energy (Fig. 1). Haze is reflected in the low frequency 
% information in the color channels, and we capture this by applying a 
% local averaging filter (the first Laws mask) to the color channels. 
% Lastly, to compute an estimate of texture gradient that is robust to 
% noise, we convolve the intensity channel with six oriented edge filters.
